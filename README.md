# Vocabulary Quiz App (Flutter)

This is a **simple vocabulary learning app** built with **Flutter**, intended as a **proof-of-concept** for a larger project aimed at helping Greek-speaking students learn Russian through mnemonic techniques and etymology-based methods.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The app demonstrates the **core mechanics of a vocabulary quiz**:

- Shows words in random order  
- Users can **tap to reveal the meaning ("Δες τη λύση")**  
- A **"Επόμενη" button** cycles through words  
- **End screen** appears when all words are completed  

> This is just a **basic prototype**. The planned full application will help Greek-speaking students learn Russian using:
> - **Mnemonic methods**  
> - **Etymology-based connections** between Greek and Russian words  
> - Effective learning strategies for vocabulary retention

## 🛠 How it was built

- Developed in **Flutter** on Windows  
- Used **AI tools (ChatGPT)** to assist with:
  - Code structure  
  - Logic for randomization and tap-to-reveal  
  - UI design ideas  
- Implemented **from scratch**, demonstrating initiative, problem-solving, and ability to learn new technologies quickly
